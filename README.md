## Purpose

This app was built to demonstrate core Flutter concepts, including:

- Stateful and stateless widget management
- User input handling
- Conditional UI rendering
- Custom styling with themes and widgets
- Layout using Rows, Columns, and Cards
- Smooth user interaction with gesture detection
- Gradient background and modern UI design

## Architecture Overview

The app follows a simple, flat architecture with all logic housed within `main.dart` for demonstration purposes. It uses:

- `MaterialApp` as the root widget for theming and routing
- `StatefulWidget` to handle temperature conversion logic and input state
- Internal methods to render UI components (`_buildConversionCard`, `_buildHistoryCard`)
